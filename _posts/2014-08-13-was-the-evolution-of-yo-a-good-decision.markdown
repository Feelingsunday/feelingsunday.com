[Yo, The One-Word Messaging App, Updates So It’s Not Quite So Absurdly Simple Anymore](http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/12/yo-grows-up/)

The first impression of Yo was ‘What is this?’ Yo is a messaging app that allows its users to only send the word ‘Yo’ to their friends. I became curious of what the customer value of this not-so-special app with only an alarm function is. (Could adding a simple alarm function to existing messaging apps be considered its customer value?)

‘Yo’ had received seed money and reached 1,000,000 downloads in a short period of time. Fueled by its recent $1.5 million in seed funding at a $10 million valuation, the company’s value also increased. ‘Yo’ began to add other functions to its updated versions. The most notable of such was the ‘Index’. (Functions had been added to a simple customer value. Would costumers be in favor of such additions?)

The ‘Index’ function allowed users to connect to other services and thereby combine the service with the alarm function by sending ‘Yo’. For example,

One of ‘Yo’s Index is ‘INSTAYO’. If an Instagram user adds one of his/her followers to YO, the user will be notified by Yo when the follower has a new posting.

Instagram already has an alarm function for when there are new postings. YO is providing the same function to its users.

There are many more services added to ‘Index’ other than Instagram and its numbers will keep growing. (Services willing to be included in the ‘Index’ can freely request to be added.)

## Conclusion

Yo seems to have expanded its service with the goal of substituting the existing alarm functions in other services with theirs. I started asking some questions after witnessing the expansion of Yo.

1. Will Yo be able to maintain its customer value even with its expansion?
2. Will Yo, an app that gives the impression of ‘What is this?’, be valuable to the customers?
3. A Will the customer value of existing social media gradually decrease?
