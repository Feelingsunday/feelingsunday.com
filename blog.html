‘Connection monopolization’ can be easily seen in photo sharing social media. The user’s interests are usually concentrated on certain photos. Whether or not these popular pictures are universally favorable is questionable. Another question arises when you compare the number of ‘followings’ with the number of ‘followers’.
</br>Are popular photos on Instagram that received many ‘likes’, ones that everyone would like? Why are there much more followers compared to followings?
</br>For celebrities, this is possible. But why and how is it the same for ordinary people as well? One might simply think that this is because ‘people are too busy with their lives they find it difficult to follow everyone that follows them. Nor do they feel the need to do so.’
</br>This phenomenon goes against the basic characteristic of social media: ‘formation of connections and relations’. If not for ‘connections’ and ‘relations’, why do people share their photos? Or is it just ‘photo uploading’ rather than ‘sharing’?
</br>Questions remain unanswered. Some might easily answer these questions. “To gain popularity and maintain it.” The instinct of wanting to expose oneself can be an explanation to the questions of why people use Social media. (‘Exposure’ may be the ultimate reason of why people use social media)
</br>The pictures that are likely to receive many ‘likes’ are predictable. When you share pictures on Instagram, you not only share the picture itself but also the uploader, number of ‘likes’, and also the comments. This distorts the users from pressing ‘like’ just by looking at the photo.
</br>==================
</br>With advancements in technology, a new world of ‘connecting’ with people and ‘communicating’ with them has opened. It has however, brought side effects such as inequality. Nevertheless, people who are willing to form connections are communicating by forming unilateral relations. For users who can’t take part in these relations or connections, social media is just a medium by which they peek in to other people’s lives.
