<br/>
Most exhibitions present works of similar types under one theme. Others are composed of works in similar fields or of one individual’s works throughout his/her lifetime.
<br/>KIAF, however, is different.
<br/>This exhibition is composed of various works from all over the world. An exhibition of this size that also presents new artists’ works is uncommon. I enjoy visiting KIAF once every one or two years. Each time, I experience something different.
<br/>The first time I went to KIAF was during college.
<br/>I was assigned to go to an exhibition and right a report about it. My first impression of KIAF was one of confusion.
<br/>To begin with, the scale of the exhibition was breathtaking. There were several entrances and each gallery was divided into its own respective areas. I got lost a couple times during my tour of the exhibition.
<br/>Everything seemed new to me so I took a lot of pictures.
<br/>During college, I visited KIAF every year. And this year, I went to KIAF for the first time after graduation.
<br/>Having gone to KIAF many times as well as other exhibitions, I came to realize some differences that KIAF has from other exhibitions. I would like to briefly mention some of them.The lighting in most exhibitions are usually dim while highlighting only on the works.
<br/>But the lighting at KIAF is much too bright.It gives you the impression that you are at a big grocery store.Why would they use such unconventional lighting?
<br/>Unlike other exhibitions where the purpose is to display the artwork, KIAF’s purpose is to sell the pieces. Therefore it is different from other exhibitions that display the works by means of lighting and interior.
<br/>No one knows which artwork will be sold. All the works displayed are there to be sold. Therefore each piece receives the same lighting like the different items at the grocery store.
<br/>Also, the fact that the organizing committee doesn’t allow individual galleries to have its own concepts contributes to this grocery store-like atmosphere. Another contributing factor to this atmosphere is space arrangement.
<br/>Most exhibitions have a path in which the viewers are expected to follow so that they can view all the displayed works in order. KIAF, however, does not have such designated path. Rather it is arranged like combination of display stand. Viewers, therefore, have to go through the same path several times to view the whole exhibition.
<br/>Like markets, there are parts of the exhibition that sell well while others don’t. My impression of artworks being displayed as consumer goods was that artworks are no more than a means of showing off one’s wealth.
<br/> Be extremely good at drawing, present a groundbreaking creative depiction, or implement some philosophy. Modern art had been pursuing groundbreaking creativeness for quite some time now, which makes it hard for artist to bring in new creativity. So these days, artists seem to try harder to be extremely good at drawing.
<br/>The best pieces are ones that are well drawn, depicted with creativity, and tell a story with philosophy. But such works are of world class and are very rare. Some works are displayed for the second time and what was once creative becomes clichéd. With people these days always wanting something new and easily getting bored, it has become almost impossible to come up with groundbreaking works all the time. Even the most unusual, original methods of depiction have become widespread. Only one artwork caught my attention throughout the whole exhibition as being groundbreaking.  (It was groundbreaking to me since it made me think “Money could be spent in such wasteful way” It was composed of the broken failed pieces of famous artists who use pottery. The broken pieces were attached to a surface of pure gold. Each work of this kind was worth a few 10million won. More surprisingly, this kind of work was sold out all the time. Creative Economy! )
<br/>There are works that are at KIAF every time I visit. It could even be called an ART PAY rather than ART FAIR But it offers the most diverse art works in one exhibition that you could go to in Korea.
<br/>If you haven’t been to KIAF you should definitely check it out!!
