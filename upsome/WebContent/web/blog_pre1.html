I recently read an article that said people are gradually stepping away from using social media such as Facebook and Twitter. By stepping away, the article probably didn’t mean that people are completely deserting these services but rather that people are less actively using them. (A high proportion of American users use two or more social media.)
<br/>Snapchat, Whisper, Ello are often referred to as ‘3rd generation social media’. These new services bare different characteristics from previously existing social media and are popular among users in their teens and 20’s. Let’s take a look at the 1st and 2nd generation social media.
<br/> Blogs represent the first generation. ‘Connection’ and ‘contents’ characterize the first generation. Users wanted to ‘connect’ and form relations with both people they know and don’t know. The medium of this ‘connection’ was ‘common interest’. Theses common interests became ‘contents’ and completed the formation of the first generation social media.
<br/>With the emergence of the mobile era, the web-based first generation evolved in to the second generation social media with new forms. The restrictions involving time and place of the web was completely overcome by the mobile era.  Users were now able to approach ‘connection’ and ‘communication’ in real time. The cameras on the mobile devices allowed the text based contents to evolve in to pictures and video clips.
<br/>The mobile also gave birth to an unexpected form of contents: short messages. On the web, the length of the contents was not a problem, but in the mobile world, the small screens made it difficult for users to type in and also read long contents.
<br/> These characteristics of the mobile era led to the creation and growth of second generation social media such as Facebook and Twitter. Messaging services also replaced SMS, and became a key player among the many social media.
<br/> ====================
<br/>Overcoming time and space restrictions, converting text-based contents to picture or video based contents, and short messaging strengthened ‘connection’ and ‘communication’, the core values of social media. At the same time however, there has become an overflow of instant moment based contents. Also, unlike the initial aim to create a broad connection network, the connections are concentrated on only a few users, creating ‘connection monopolization’.
